Here are some of the most commonly used annotations in Spring Boot:

1. `@SpringBootApplication`: This is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
   - `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
   - `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
   - `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the specified package¹.

2. `@RestController`: This is a specialized version of the controller. It includes the `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` annotations and means that the class is a Controller¹.

3. `@RequestMapping`: Annotation for mapping web requests onto methods in request-handling classes with flexible method signatures¹.

4. `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`: These are shortcut annotations for `@RequestMapping` method with `RequestMethod.GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` respectively¹.

5. `@PathVariable`: Indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a URI template variable¹.

6. `@RequestParam`: Indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a web request parameter¹.

7. `@RequestBody`: Indicates a method parameter should be bound to the body of the web request¹.

8. `@Autowired`: This annotation is used to auto-wire spring bean on setter methods, constructor, a property or methods with arbitrary names and/or multiple arguments¹.

9. `@Service`: Indicates that an annotated class is a "Service" (e.g. a business service facade)¹.

10. `@Repository`: Indicates that an annotated class is a "Repository", originally defined by Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as "a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects"¹.

11. `@Component`: Indicates that an annotated class is a "component". Such classes are considered as candidates for auto-detection when using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning¹.

12. `@Bean`: Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container¹.

13. `@ConfigurationProperties`: Annotation for externalized configuration¹.

14. `@EnableConfigurationProperties`: Enable support for `@ConfigurationProperties`¹.

15. `@Value`: Annotation at the field or method/constructor parameter level that indicates a default value expression for the affected argument¹.

16. `@Profile`: Indicates that a component is eligible for registration when one or more specified profiles are active¹.

17. `@PropertySource`: Annotation providing a convenient and declarative mechanism for adding a PropertySource to Spring's Environment¹.

18. `@Import`: Indicates one or more component classes to import — typically @Configuration classes¹.

19. `@ImportResource`: Indicates one or more resources containing bean definitions to import¹.

20. `@Controller`: Indicates that an annotated class is a "Controller" (e.g. a web controller)¹.

21. `@ControllerAdvice`: A specialization of `@Component` for classes that declare `@ExceptionHandler`, `@InitBinder`, or `@ModelAttribute` methods to be shared across multiple `@Controller` classes¹.

22. `@ExceptionHandler`: Annotation for handling exceptions in specific handler classes and/or handler methods¹.

23. `@ResponseBody`: Annotation that indicates a method return value should be bound to the web response body¹.

24. `@Qualifier`: This annotation is used along with `@Autowired` annotation to avoid confusion when multiple instances of bean type is present¹.

25. `@Scope`: This annotation is used to specify the scope of the beans¹.

26. `@Lazy`: This annotation is used at class level as well as method level to indicate that a bean is to be lazily initialized¹.

27. `@Primary`: This annotation is used when we have more than one bean of the same type and we want to give preference to one of them to be used for autowiring¹.

28. `@Order`: Annotation that defines sorting priority for annotated components¹.

29. `@Async`: Indicates that the annotated method must be invoked in a separate thread¹.

30. `@Scheduled`: Annotation that marks a method to be scheduled¹.

These annotations are widely used in Spring Boot applications and can help streamline your development process¹.

Here are some additional Spring annotations that are not included in your list:

1. `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy`: Enables support for handling components marked with AspectJ's `@Aspect` annotation.
2. `@EnableTransactionManagement`: Enables Spring's annotation-driven transaction management capability.
3. `@EnableCaching`: Enables Spring's annotation-driven cache management capability.
4. `@Cacheable`: Indicates that the result of invoking a method (or all methods in a class) can be cached.
5. `@CacheEvict`: Demarcates methods that perform cache eviction, that is methods that act as triggers for removing data from the cache.
6. `@CachePut`: Updates the cache without interfering with the method execution.
7. `@EnableScheduling`: Enables Spring's scheduled task execution capability.
8. `@EnableWebMvc`: Enables default Spring MVC configuration and provides the functionality equivalent to `<mvc:annotation-driven/>` in XML.
9. `@SessionAttributes`: Specifies that a model attribute should be stored in the session.
10. `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity`: Enables method-level security based on annotations.
11. `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`, `@PreFilter`, `@PostFilter`: Annotations for method security.
12. `@Transactional`: Describes transaction attributes on a method or class.
13. `@EnableJpaRepositories`: Enables JPA repositories. Will scan the package of the annotated configuration class for Spring Data repositories by default.
14. `@Entity`: Specifies that the class is an entity and is mapped to a database table.
15. `@Table`: Specifies the primary table for the annotated entity.
16. `@Column`: Specifies the mapped column for a persistent property or field.
17. `@Id`: Specifies the primary key of an entity.
18. `@GeneratedValue`: Provides for the specification of generation strategies for the values of primary keys.
19. `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToOne`, `@ManyToMany`: Define the different associations between entities.
20. `@JoinColumn`: Specifies a column for joining an entity association or element collection.
21. `@Embeddable`: Defines a class whose instances are stored as an intrinsic part of an owning entity and share the identity of the entity.
22. `@Embedded`: Specifies a persistent field or property of an entity whose value is an instance of an embeddable class.
23. `@MappedSuperclass`: Designates a class whose mapping information is applied to the entities that inherit from it.
24. `@EnableJms`: Enables detection of JmsListener annotations on any Spring-managed bean in the container.
25. `@JmsListener`: Indicates that a method is to be invoked to consume a JMS message.
26. `@SendTo`: Defines the destination to which normal payloads or exceptions should be sent after method processing.
27. `@ExceptionHandler`: Annotation for handling exceptions in specific handler classes and/or handler methods.
28. `@ResponseStatus`: Marks a method or exception class with the status code and reason that should be returned.
29. `@InitBinder`: Identifies methods which initialize the WebDataBinder which will be used for populating command and form object arguments of annotated handler methods.
30. `@SessionAttribute`: Indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a session attribute.

Please note that these annotations are part of the broader Spring Framework and not just Spring Boot¹². They are used in various contexts such as web development, data access, and configuration¹².
